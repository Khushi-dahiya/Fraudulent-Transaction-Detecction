This repository tackles the crucial challenge of identifying fraudulent transactions using the power of XGBoost, a robust machine learning algorithm. Ô∏è But we don't stop there! We add a sprinkle of fun and clarity with emoji annotations throughout the code and documentation.

What you'll find here:üîç

XGBoost Implementation: Train and optimize an XGBoost model to discriminate between genuine and fraudulent transactions based on various features.
Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Dive into the world of financial data, cleaning, feature engineering, and preparing it for the model.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the XGBoost model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.‚ú® 

Getting Started:

Clone the repository.
Set up the environment with the required libraries.
Follow the instructions in the README.md files within each subfolder for detailed steps.
Train the XGBoost model and analyze its performance.

Bonus:üôå

This project utilizes the Fraud Dataset from Kaggle for training and evaluation (link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chitwanmanchanda/fraudulent-transactions-data).
